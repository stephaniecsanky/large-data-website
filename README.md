# Dog Breeds of the World

Dogs truly are man's best friend. They are reliable, playful, friendly and loyal.There are over a hundred breeds and we have so much to learn about dogs.

I look forward to learning and sharing my growing knowledge about dogs.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites and gaining experience with Git/GitHub.

Iâ€™m excited to learn more about dogs, their behaviour and the various breeds, as I have a dog allergy but can tolerate some dogs.

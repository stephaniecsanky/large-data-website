         <h1>How To Select Your New Best Friend</h1>
		 <p>Best friends are good listeners and always happy to see you. They are always there to lend a shoulder to cry on. Whether jogging partners or worthy sporting opponents, they spring to your defense whenever needed. Best friends are loyal, steadfast and true. And they always know how to make you laugh! While it may take years to find a new human best friend, your new canine best friend awaits you at the local shelter.</p>

          <p>During the months of November in December, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and your local shelter invite you to come to the shelter and meet your new best friend. As a reminder, you can view many of these dog breeds mentioned in the article below on the <a href="../breeds/index.html">Most Popular Breeds</a> page.</p>
			<p>Here are some considerations when selecting your new best friend:</p>
			<h3>Match your personalities</h3>
          <ul class="disc">
					<li>If you’re gregarious and like to talk to strangers, a unique-looking mixed breed or rare purebred will bring you lots of attention and questions.</li>
					<li>If you are reserved and like to keep to yourself, an all-black or black and tan shepherd mix will help you blend in. Many of the guardian breeds such as Rottweilers and German Shepherds are most comfortable as “one-person” dogs.</li>
					<li>If your home is filled with children, roommates, or visitors, consider selecting a dog that has never met a human he didn’t like. Retrievers, setters, spaniels and their mixed brethren are generally very friendly and unflappable.</li>
				</ul>

          <h3>Match your energy levels</h3>
          <ul class="disc">
				<li>Are you athletic and love the outdoors in any season? You’d be a great match for an active dog with a medium thick coat like a retriever mix.</li>
				<li>If winter sports are your forte and you love to go cross country skiing or hiking through the snow, a husky mix is ideal.</li>
				<li>Are you a fair weather stroller? A retired racing greyhound is a marvelous walking companion.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Maybe a certain appearance appeals to you</h3>
          <ul class="disc">
				<li>Are you drawn to curly or silky-locked breeds? Dogs with lots of coat will need lots of coat care. This could include daily brushing and trips to the groomer every 4-6 weeks.</li>
				<li>Do the teddy bear looks of the double-coated northern breeds (Chows, Akitas, Elkhounds, sled dogs and their mixes) appeal to you? Just be prepared for extra grooming during shedding season, extra exercise on cool days and extra air conditioning during the dog days of summer.</li>
				<li>If strength, playfulness, and a wash and wear coat appeal to you, how about a pit bull?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Regardless of which dog you choose, all great friendships blossom when proper care and consideration are taken. Your shelter is not only happy to assist you in match-making, they will provide you with the materials to make it work!</p>

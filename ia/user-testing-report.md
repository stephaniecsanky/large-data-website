## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- There were no critical issues.

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- There were no serious user-experience hindering issues.

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- Small issue where sometimes links won't be clickable, but I seemed to have fixed this before the user testing
